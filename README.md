## Why?

The Google Play Store is the de-facto app store in the Android ecosystem.
However, many users are unsatisfied with some of its practices and policies such
as mandatory [Play App Signing] for new apps and the need for a Google account
to use the store. These users often turn to F-Droid, which fails to adhere to
the Android security model and provide timely and secure app updates from a
store with strict minimum security requirements.

Accrescent aims to resolve the security, privacy, and usability concerns of
existing Android app stores by addressing said concerns fundamentally in its
design.
